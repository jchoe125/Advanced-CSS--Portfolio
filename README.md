Homework #2 - Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

**Homework Description**
* In this unit, we learned how to build web apps that incorporate responsive web design and advanced CSS features (e.g. flexbox, media queries, CSS variables). For this homework assignment, these concepts will be implemented to build a responsive, mobile-friendly portfolio web application.

* Since there are no web applications to showcase at this point, placeholder images and names were used in the work section of the portfolio.

**Rationale**
* More and more users are browsing the web from a mobile device, which has changed how developers think about layout and design. Advanced CSS features like media queries and flexbox make it easier to accommodate multiple screen sizes and to build apps with a mobile-first mindset. Similarly, website design has evolved to include many niceties that users now take for granted, such as animated hover effects, rounded corners, and shadows. In the old days of the web, these tricks would have required some complex workarounds or even JavaScript, but newer CSS properties have simplified their implementation.

**Goals**
* When the portfolio is loaded, we are presented with my name, an avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and contact info
When one of the links in the navigations is clicked, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When the work link is clicked, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
The first work application's image should be larger in size than the others
Clicking on the images of the work applications takes the user to the deployed application
Resizing the page or viewing the site on various screens and devices presents the user with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport

* The following screenshot shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
